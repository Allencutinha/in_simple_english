    "## Cubic interpolation\n",
    "Let's assume that we want to interpolate the value in between two given points. And we are not interested in linear interpolation, but would like to fit a polynomial of degree 3. The general equation for the polynomial of degree 3 is:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d\n",
    "$$\n",
    " Let's also assume that we want to interpolate for values $x \\in [0,1]$, where f(0) and f(1) are given.\n",
    " So to fit f(x) we need to find the coefficients (a,b,c,d). For now we have 4 unknowns (a,b,c,d) and 2 equations (for f(0) and f(1)), which gives us underdefined system of linear equations. (Note: the unknowns are a,b,c and d and they are linear).\n",
    " \n",
    " **Hypothesis 1**  To compensate for this problem we take into account the first derivatives in given points f'(0) and f'(1).\n",
    " \n",
    "**Hypothesis 2** My natural solution, however, would be to add more points to build the system. Somehow this is not a solution I found (???)\n",
    "\n",
    "Following hypothesis 1 for now.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    f'(x) = 3ax^2 + 2bx + c\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we can obtain the following system of equations:   \n",
    "$\n",
    "    f(0) = d \\\\\n",
    "    f(1) = a + b + c +d \\\\\n",
    "    f'(0) = c \\\\\n",
    "    f'(1) = 3a + 2b + c\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving for a, b, c, d:  \n",
    "\\begin{eqnarray}\n",
    "    d &=& f(0) \\\\\n",
    "    c &=& f'(0) \\\\\n",
    "    b &=& 3f(1)-2f'(0) - 3f(0) - f'(1) \\\\\n",
    "    a &=& -2f(1) + f'(0) + 2f(0) + f'(1)\n",
    "\\end{eqnarray}\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, found polynomial coefficients. But how do we know the derivatives given just f(0) and f(1)? This is a point in time where we need two extra points and the knowledge of finite differences :smile:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider the following example. We are given points $[-1,p_0]$, $[0,p_1]$, $[1,p_2]$ and $[2, p_3]$, where $x,f(x)]$. and we want to interpolate between $[0, p_1]$ and $[1, p_2]$.\n",
    "Then,  \n",
    "$\n",
    "    f(0) = p_1 \\\\\n",
    "    f(1) = p_2 \\\\\n",
    "    f'(0) = (p_2 - p_0) / 1-(-1)  \\\\\n",
    "    f'(1) = (p_3 - p_1) / 2  \\\\\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "the following holds:\n",
    "\\begin{eqnarray}\n",
    "    a &=& -2p_2 + 0.5(p_2 - p_0) + 2p_1 + 0.5(p_3 - p_1) \\\\\n",
    "    b &=& 2p_2 + p_0 - 3p_1- 0.5(p_3 - p_1) \\\\\n",
    "    c &=& 0.5(p_2 - p_0) \\\\\n",
    "    d &=& p_1\n",
    "\\end{eqnarray}\n",
    "\n",
    "**Warning** This only works if your x is between 0 and 1 and all the points are located at distance 1 from each other in x axis."
